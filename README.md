# HighSchool ComputerScience Projects

This is a collection of everything I coded throughout high school, whether it be in computer science class or in my own spare time. Under Java projects is a series of files that I coded in preparation for the Canadian Computing Competition, and under the C# projects folder is everything coded in computer science class.
