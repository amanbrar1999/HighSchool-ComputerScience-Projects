#Practice Projects

This is a collection of dozens of small projects I have made over the years, whether it be in a computer science class or in my own spare time. Under Java projects is a series of files that I coded in preparation for the Canadian Computing Competition, and under the C# projects folder is everything coded in some computer science classes.
