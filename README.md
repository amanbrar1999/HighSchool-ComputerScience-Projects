# HighSchool ComputerScience Projects

This is a collection of everything I coded throughout high school, whether it be in computer science class or in my own spare time. Under Netbeans projects is a series of files that I coded in preperation for the Canadian Computer Competition, and under the projects folder is everything coded in computer science class.

Projects can be found on my google drive: https://drive.google.com/open?id=0B1eM6to-9MCzZU5tM0U1cFFZQmM
